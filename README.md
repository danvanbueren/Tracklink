## Context

### Inspiration

**Hi, I'm Dan**, an overly vertically integrated music producer, engineer, vocalist, songwriter, and everything in between. I've been making music for over fifteen years and have spent much of that experience collaborating with fellow musicians.

Through this experience, I have learned that project management can strangle productivity and completely interrupt the creative flow. I have spent the past six years looking for an all-in-one project management solution to support and sustain distributed management for tracks and projects to no avail. While there are some promising programs on the horizon, I have yet to find a polished, mature and feature-complete program to meet this goal.

Well, guess what? I occasionally pretend to be a web developer. Through this time, this small thought slowly blossomed into a full-scale platform while I iterated through my own development of the platform I have christened Tracklink.

### Mission

**Tracklink** seeks to offer music producers, engineers and artists a full suite of integrated project management functions in one simple, optimized platform. I have noticed over the course of my own collaboration that musicians have to bend over backwards by using a multitude of different platforms and tools to share ideas and files. My goal with this software is to eliminate the management disaster incurred from using so many platforms.

After years of planning, I have drawn inspiration from the best features across noteworthy platforms like Google Drive for its excellent file management system, Discord for its intuitive UX, Spotify for its playback, and social media platforms for their chronological social activity features.
